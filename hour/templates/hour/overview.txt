My first imaginations

My idea is to create a web-site to display working hours for employees of fictive company XY.
Every employee has to register/login to the system to do CRUD operations.
Every day record in the db contains (data are created by users):
    - date of the current day
    - morning login
    - lunch pause start
    - lunch pause end
    - evening logout

Functionalities:
    - want to implement NOW button, to select current time for each part of day's records
    - edit button to change data manually
    - calendar display to chose a date
    - clock display to chose a wished time
    - for every day: count how much working hours I have + how much is extra
    - for every month: count how much working hours I have + how much is extra
    - create a pdf report to display these records every month

Idea to improve:
    - implement sick days/doctors visits

Each user:
    - has his/her own profile (personal info + photo ...)
    - can sent a message to his/her college/boss ... (to registered user)
